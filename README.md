# AI Fact Checker Chatbot

This project is a simple Python-based AI chatbot that evaluates user-submitted facts and responds with "True" or "False". It uses the `transformers` library and a pre-trained natural language understanding model (`facebook/bart-large-mnli`) to classify facts. The chatbot processes user input, applies zero-shot classification, and provides an instant truthfulness check based on model predictions.

### Features:
- Interactive chatbot interface
- Uses a pre-trained transformer model for fact-checking
- Responds with "True" or "False" to user-input facts
- Lightweight and easy to run locally

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `transformers` library

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install transformers`.
3. Run the script and input facts for evaluation.
